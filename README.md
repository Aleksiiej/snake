C++ Snake Game Project
Project Overview:
This project is a modern reinterpretation of the classic Snake game, developed in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. The focus of this project was to advance my C++ programming skills and tackle unique challenges, particularly in the area of input/output operations on the Linux platform.

Key Features:

Object-Oriented Programming: Built using OOP methodologies in C++, ensuring a well-organized and maintainable code structure.
Linux System Compatibility: Specifically optimized for Linux, addressing unique challenges such as keyboard input handling in the absence of Windows-specific functions like getch().
Input Handling: Custom implementation of keyboard input functionalities to ensure a responsive and intuitive game experience.
Development Environment: Developed in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using CMake as the build system, showcasing proficiency in modern development tools and practices.
Technical Stack:

Language: C++
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, CMake
Platform: Linux
Project Goals:

Skill Enhancement: Aimed at honing C++ programming skills, particularly in the context of game development.
Problem-Solving: Addressed specific challenges in Linux system programming, such as input/output operations and cross-platform development.
Personal Enjoyment: Blended the joy of gameplay with the creative process of developing a game from scratch.
Learning Experience: Served as a practical learning exercise in handling system-level programming nuances in Linux.
Getting Started:

Ensure C++ and CMake are installed on your Linux system.
Clone the repository.
Use CMake to build the project and run the game.
